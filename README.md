Using Spring rest-shell:

The current spring-rest shell does not support templated urls using HAL. 
This fork does: https://github.com/faisalferoz/rest-shell
Follow the Readme to build and install.

Unfortunately, the HTTP method PATCH is not supported by the fork above.
I have forked the fork to make the shell support patch.
